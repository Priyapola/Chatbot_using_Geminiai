Chatbot Using Google Generative AI
Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the development of a simple chatbot using Google Generative AI (Gemini Model). The chatbot can interact with users and generate intelligent responses based on the user’s input. It uses the google.generativeai API to configure the Gemini model for 
natural language understanding and conversation generation.

Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language for building the chatbot.
Google Generative AI (Gemini): Google's latest language model used to generate context-aware and intelligent text responses.
API Integration: The code utilizes Google Cloud’s API to authenticate and communicate with the Gemini model.
Input/Output via Console: Simple console-based interaction to take user input and display the AI response.

How It Works:
The chatbot uses the google.generativeai Python package to interact with the Gemini model.
The API key is used to authenticate and configure the connection to the Gemini model.
The chatbot continuously accepts user input through the console and sends it to the Gemini model.
The model generates a response that is returned and displayed back to the user.
The loop continues until the user types "exit."

Key Components of the Code:
genai.configure(api_key="..."): Configures the API key to authenticate the application and access Google’s generative model.
model.generate_content(user_input): Sends the user input to the Gemini model, which generates a relevant response based on its understanding of the input.
while True: loop: Keeps the program running continuously, accepting user input and providing chatbot responses until the user types "exit".
Running the Chatbot
To run the chatbot on your local machine:

Ensure you have the required Google Generative AI library installed. You can install it using:
bash
pip install google-generativeai
Run the Python script in your terminal or command prompt.
Start interacting with the chatbot by typing in the terminal. Type "exit" to end the conversation.
Security Considerations
Keep your API Key secure. Do not expose it in publicly accessible code repositories to prevent misuse.
Follow Google Cloud's best practices for managing API keys, such as using environment variables to store sensitive credentials instead of hardcoding them.
Potential Enhancements
User Input Validation: Add validation for user input to handle unexpected cases.
Deployment: Package the chatbot into a web service using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI, enabling users to interact with the bot through a web browser.
Advanced Features: Integrate additional functionalities like sentiment analysis, user intent detection, or a more complex state management system for conversation flow.
